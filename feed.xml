As said by Guy Beart,</p> <blockquote> <p>Turbulence toiler, on the rack, For each step forward, two steps back!</p> </blockquote> <p>By now, we still don’t fully understand where turbulence comes from (the transition between laminar and turbulent states) and where it goes (toward somewhat ultimate scaling?). Scientists have been working hard on this problem for decades, flaring sparks on the boundless ocean to guide the later generations. And now, it’s our turn to continue this voyage.</p> <h4 id="reference">Reference</h4> <blockquote> <p>Davidson, P. A., Kaneda, Y., Moffatt, K., &amp; Sreenivasan, K. R. (Eds.). (2011).
