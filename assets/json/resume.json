			"url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2025.10340",
			"summary": "Four-way coupled PP-DNS shows that increasing particle inertia first enhances, then reduces drag, before returning to the single-phase state. Turbulence modulation is driven by the competition between particle-induced transport and dissipation, as revealed by a comprehensive two-phase statistical analysis. Analytical examination of limiting Stokes numbers (0 or âˆž) clarifies particle inertia effects."
